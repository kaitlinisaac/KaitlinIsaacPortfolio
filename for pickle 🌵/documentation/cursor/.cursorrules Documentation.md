[Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-powered code editor. `.cursorrules` files define custom rules for Cursor AI to follow when generating code, allowing you to tailor its behavior to your specific needs and preferences.

## Why .cursorrules?

`.cursorrules` is a powerful feature in Cursor AI that allows developers to define project-specific instructions for the AI. Here's why you might want to use it:

1. **Customized AI Behavior**: `.cursorrules` files help tailor the AI's responses to your project's specific needs, ensuring more relevant and accurate code suggestions.
    
2. **Consistency**: By defining coding standards and best practices in your `.cursorrules` file, you can ensure that the AI generates code that aligns with your project's style guidelines.
    
3. **Context Awareness**: You can provide the AI with important context about your project, such as commonly used methods, architectural decisions, or specific libraries, leading to more informed code generation.
    
4. **Improved Productivity**: With well-defined rules, the AI can generate code that requires less manual editing, speeding up your development process.
    
5. **Team Alignment**: For team projects, a shared `.cursorrules` file ensures that all team members receive consistent AI assistance, promoting cohesion in coding practices.
    
6. **Project-Specific Knowledge**: You can include information about your project's structure, dependencies, or unique requirements, helping the AI to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.
    

By creating a `.cursorrules` file in your project's root directory, you can leverage these benefits and enhance your coding experience with Cursor AI.

// Organization of rules
Organize .cursorrules files into the following main categories within the 'rules' directory:
  - Frontend Frameworks and Libraries
  - Backend and Full-Stack
  - Mobile Development
  - CSS and Styling
  - State Management
  - Database and API
  - Testing
  - Build Tools and Development
  - Language-Specific
  - Other
Place each .cursorrules file directly in the 'rules' folder
The folder name for each .cursorrules file should describe the category and content of the file
Refer to the README in each folder for guidance on naming conventions and descriptions

// Naming and formatting
Use descriptive names for .cursorrules files and their folders, following the pattern: 'technology-focus-cursorrules-prompt-file'
Maintain alphabetical order within each category in the README.md file
Use consistent formatting for list items in the README.md file

// Content guidelines
When creating or editing .cursorrules files, focus on project-specific instructions and best practices
Include comments in .cursorrules files to explain complex rules or provide context
Use clear and concise language in all documentation and .cursorrules files
Provide context on what you're building, style guidelines, or info on commonly-used methods

// Optional README for credit and description
Each .cursorrules file may have an accompanying README.md file in its folder
Use this README to provide credit to the original author and a brief description of the .cursorrules file's purpose

// Maintenance and updates
Update the README.md file when adding new .cursorrules files, placing them in the correct category
Ensure all links in the README.md file are relative and correct
When updating the README.md, ensure the table of contents remains accurate
When adding new categories, update both the 'Contents' and 'Rules' sections of the README.md
Regularly review and update categorization as the repository grows

// Best practices
Maintain consistency in capitalization and punctuation throughout the repository
When referencing Cursor AI, always use the correct capitalization and spacing
When adding examples or explanations, focus on practical use cases for Cursor AI users
If a .cursorrules file fits multiple categories, place it in the most relevant one and cross-reference in others if necessary
Keep the 'Other' category for .cursorrules files that don't fit neatly into the main categories

// Additional insights
.cursorrules files are repo-specific "Rules for AI"
.cursorrules files should be placed in the root of the repository
The content of .cursorrules files will be appended to the global "Rules for AI" settings in Cursor
Focus on providing repo-level context and guidelines, not just general coding practices
.cursorrules can include information about project structure, architectural decisions, and commonly used libraries or methods
Consider including rules for handling specific file types or coding patterns unique to your project
Rules can cover both code generation and code understanding aspects for Cursor AI
