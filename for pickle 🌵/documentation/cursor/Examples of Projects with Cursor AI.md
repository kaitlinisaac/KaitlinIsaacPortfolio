# Examples of Projects with Cursor AI

This guide showcases various practical examples of how to use Cursor AI for different development scenarios, from beginner to advanced use cases.

## Interactive Game Development

### Chrome-Style Dinosaur Game
**Purpose**: Create a simple browser-based game similar to Chrome's offline dinosaur game.

**Components**:
- Canvas-based game environment
- Score tracking system
- Collision detection
- Pixel art graphics

**Example Prompt**:
```
Create a game similar to the Chrome offline dinosaur game where you jump over cactuses. Include a high score system and make all designs in pixel art style.
```

**Benefits**: 
- Quick prototyping of game mechanics
- Automated generation of basic game logic
- Learning game development concepts through AI-assisted coding

## Basic UI Development

### Interactive Button Component
**Purpose**: Create a responsive UI element with state management.

**Components**:
- Styled button component
- Click event handling
- State management for text display
- CSS styling for visual feedback

**Example Prompt**:
```
Create a centered button that:
1. Has rounded corners
2. Shows different text when clicked
3. Uses a column format layout
```

**Benefits**:
- Rapid UI prototyping
- Learning React component structure
- Understanding state management

## Project Setup and Configuration

### React Development Environment
**Purpose**: Set up a complete React development environment from scratch.

**Steps**:
1. Project initialization
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Directory navigation
   ```bash
   cd [project-path]/projects/javascript
   ```
3. Dependency installation
   ```bash
   npm install react-scripts
   ```
4. Development server launch
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Streamlined environment setup
- Automated dependency management
- Live development server with hot reload

## Multi-File Project Examples

### Full-Stack Web Application
**Purpose**: Develop a complete web application with frontend and backend integration.

**Components**:
- Frontend React components
- API integration
- Database models
- Authentication system

**Using Composer (Command+I)**:
```
Create a new component in the style of app.jsx that allows a user to:
1. Log in with email/password
2. Display user profile
3. Integrate with Firebase authentication
```

## Educational Projects

### Learning Through Iteration
**Purpose**: Use Cursor AI to learn coding concepts through practical examples.

**Example Process**:
1. Start with basic code:
   ```
   Command+L: "Explain what this code does in simple terms"
   ```

2. Modify and experiment:
   ```
   Command+K: "Add form validation to this login component"
   ```

3. Explore alternatives:
   ```
   Command+L: "What are other ways to implement this feature?"
   ```

## Data Transformation Projects

### JSON Processing Application
**Purpose**: Create tools for data manipulation and transformation.

**Example Workflow**:
1. Input JSON structure:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "John",
     "age": 30,
     "addresses": [...]
   }
   ```

2. Transformation prompt:
   ```
   Convert this JSON structure to include:
   - Formatted address strings
   - Age category field
   - Calculated fields based on existing data
   ```

## Best Practices for Each Project Type

### For Beginners
- Start with single-file projects
- Use natural language in prompts
- Experiment with code modifications
- Learn from generated code explanations

### For Intermediate Developers
- Leverage multi-file editing with Composer
- Use Cursor Rules for consistency
- Combine manual coding with AI assistance
- Focus on component reusability

### For Advanced Users
- Create custom Cursor Rules for team standards
- Use Artifacts for complex specifications
- Implement advanced architecture patterns
- Optimize generated code for performance

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with simple components
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Learn from generated code

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Use multiple small prompts
   - Refine code incrementally
   - Test frequently

3. **Learning Approach**
   - Study generated code
   - Ask for explanations
   - Experiment with modifications

4. **Project Organization**
   - Maintain clear file structure
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document generated code

Remember that Cursor AI is a tool to enhance your development process, not replace it. Use these examples as starting points and adapt them to your specific needs and coding style.
