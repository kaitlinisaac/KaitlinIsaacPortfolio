## Key Takeaways

1. **No Perfect Solution**
   - Each tool has specific strengths
   - Consider project requirements
   - Combine tools when needed

2. **Development Knowledge**
   - Still required for all tools
   - AI assists but doesn't replace
   - Learning curve varies

3. **Project Scale**
   - Cursor better for larger projects
   - Agents better for quick prototypes
   - Consider long-term maintenance

4. **Cost Considerations**
   - Free tiers are limited
   - Hidden costs in some platforms
   - Consider value vs. features

5. **Technology Stack**
   - Some tools limit technology choice
   - Consider deployment requirements
   - Platform lock-in effects

Remember that AI coding tools are evolving rapidly. While they can significantly boost productivity, they work best when used as assistants rather than complete replacements for development knowledge and skills.
