## Heydon Pickering’s site

## Features

- Strong personal identity. I want to be much less dramatic moody and sad. I want more playful and fun. 
- I like his organization scheme of Writing, Projects, Artifacts, and Hire
- Visable skip link is cool to see, however, I think I would like to go with a focus-within skip link 

### Writing Page

- sub naviation of Latest, Best Of, and an RSS link
  - I would like an RSS feed for my blog
  - I like the idea of a best of as well. However, I think I would like to have the functionality there but it doesn’t get displayed until I have posts that are a Best Of. Probably over optimizing.
- The subheading for the page is like “Latest Writing” with a description about what he’s thinking about a lot recently. The best of subheading describes what the criteria for the best of.

### Projects Page

- Simple hotdog cards with an image and a title and a description of the project. The title is a hyperlink to the project website

### Artifacts Page

- grid of images, links, embedded audio, and video to various projects that don’t have a full site or wanting to have a direct embed of something cool to show off

### Hire Page

- I like his clear description about who he is, what his values are, and what he’s an expert in.
  - “I am a technical writer and designer for the web. I specialize in helping organizations develop and document inclusive language, interfaces, and processes. I do not work with surveillance capitalists or religious organizations engaged in proselytization.”
- It is followed by 3 excellent points with images to highlight them

- Then he has a list of things he can do for you and a simple call to action
- Finally ending with the places he worked for and with

## Dario Amodei Site

- I love its simplicity. I don’t love that it isn’t a cohesive site. Like his essay for Machines of Loving Grace is essentially separate from the rest of his site
- I like his table of contents for his essay. I would like that as part of my pages. Perhaps literally on all the pages if I can construct these table of contents just based off my heading structure. Could be a nice and easy way to navigate around on any page. I think I could go with fun and colorful headings for each level
- I like his light and dark switch front and center. I wish it responded to user prefernces by default though
- I think his homepage being so understated and simple is pretty badass. I think I personally want a bit of whimsy but I think I would like it to be super simple so it’s timeless and easy to maintain. I think my whimsy can come from subtle animations on interactions and fun colors
