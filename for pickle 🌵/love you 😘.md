[I made a gpt for you](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6740034e88608191a48560350f0e1472-how-to-use-cursor) that should be able to help you get around cursor! I also included different guides I wrote for my workshop that you can have AI teach to you in context of what you want to do ❤️ I also up the project details if you need to quickly tell the AI what's going on in the projects and I have the requirements and implementation plan for what I'm looking for and a rough plan on how to do it! Thanks for doing this for me! It's so impressive!!!!
