Accessibility isn't just a checkbox to tick off - it's a fundamental aspect of web development that should be considered from the very beginning of any project.

## Why Accessibility Matters

The web is for everyone. When we build accessible websites, we're not just following guidelines - we're ensuring that all users can access and interact with our content, regardless of their abilities.

## Key Principles

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use appropriate elements
   - Maintain proper heading structure
   - Implement ARIA when needed

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are focusable
   - Implement logical tab order
   - Provide skip links

## Testing for Accessibility

Regular testing should include:
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast checking
- Browser compatibility verification
