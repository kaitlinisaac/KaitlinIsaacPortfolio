# Spring Band Concert 2023

This video features the Lincoln Middle School Band performing their annual Spring Concert. The students prepared for three months to showcase their progress and musical achievements through a diverse program.

## Program

### Beginning Band
1. "First Steps March" - A piece designed to showcase fundamental skills
2. "Midnight Journey" - A mysterious, minor key exploration
3. "Celebration" - An upbeat finale with percussion highlights

### Advanced Band
1. "Ceremonial Fanfare" - A brass-focused opening piece
2. "Folk Dance Suite" - A three-movement work based on traditional melodies
3. "Cinema Spectacular" - Medley of film music favorites

## Teaching Reflections

This concert represented significant growth for many students, particularly in:
- Ensemble balance and blend
- Dynamic contrast
- Rhythmic precision

I'm particularly proud of how the percussion section coordinated multiple instruments and the way the clarinets mastered their challenging passages in "Folk Dance Suite."

## Using This Video

Music educators can use this video as:
- A demonstration of appropriate repertoire selection
- An example of effective stage presence and concert etiquette
- A reference for balanced instrumentation in middle school ensembles
