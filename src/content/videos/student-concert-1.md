# 8th Grade Winter Concert 2021

This video captures a backstage perspective of the Lincoln Middle School 8th Grade Band's Winter Concert in December 2021. You'll hear the students performing while I conduct just off stage — a behind-the-scenes look at a milestone moment in our program's return to live music.

## Program and Performance

The 8th Grade Band performed:
- **March of the Scots Guard** by Robert E. Foster
- **Dancing Kites** by Chris Bernotas
- **Chant and Fire Ritual** by Tyler S. Grant

This concert was especially meaningful — not only because of the students' dedication and musical growth, but because it marked their **first performance since the COVID-19 shutdowns**. The last time this group performed together was as sixth graders in early 2020, just weeks before the world changed.

## Teaching Reflection

These students were my very first sixth-grade band class as a new teacher, and watching them take the stage again as eighth graders was deeply rewarding. Despite the challenges of remote learning and limited ensemble practice, they showed resilience, musicality, and joy. This concert was a reminder of why live music matters — to students, to educators, and to the community.
