# 6th Grade First Concert Winter 2022

This video features the 6th Grade Band's first public performance, presenting a program of two works: **Conquest** by Brian Balmages and **Mechanical Monster** by Randall Standridge.

## Performance Context

The 6th grade band was split into two classes (A and B days), and students came together for the first time just days before this performance. A schedule change that year made band the only available elective for 6th graders, leading to lower enrollment and non-traditional instrumentation. Despite these challenges, students demonstrated strong musical fundamentals and ensemble coordination.

## Instructional Highlights

- First formal performance for all 6th grade band students
- Emphasis on foundational ensemble skills: tone, rhythm, and group timing
- Collaboration across separate classes to perform as a full ensemble
