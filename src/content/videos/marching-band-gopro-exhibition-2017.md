# Marching Band GoPro – Exhibition 2017

This video features a first-person view of my college marching band performance during a 2017 exhibition event. I recorded the show with a GoPro attached to my head while playing piccolo on the field.

## Performance Context

Marching band was a major part of my musical upbringing, and this performance captures the energy, coordination, and endurance required in that setting. While informal, this footage provides a unique perspective on what it's like to perform as a student on the field — balancing technique, drill, and ensemble awareness in real time.

## Reflection

Though not a traditional recital or concert setting, marching band shaped my identity as a musician and helped develop my sense of teamwork and performance confidence. Including this video reflects the importance of creating meaningful, memorable experiences for students — something I carry into my teaching philosophy today.
