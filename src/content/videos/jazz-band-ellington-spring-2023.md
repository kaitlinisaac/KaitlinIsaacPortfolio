# Jazz Band Spring 2023

This performance features the 7th and 8th grade auditioned Jazz Band performing **"Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me"** by Duke Ellington, arranged by DeSpain.

## Performance Context

The 2023 Jazz Band was the first to be reestablished after the COVID-19 shutdown. This performance was presented at the spring concert and demonstrates the ensemble's growth in style, listening, and independent performance. Due to an unexpected change in personnel three weeks before the concert, I performed on drum set to support the ensemble on stage.

## Instructional Highlights

- Emphasis on ensemble independence and listening without a conductor
- Reinforcement of swing style, articulation, and phrasing
- Student leadership and accountability in a small-group setting
