# Jazz Band Spring 2023

This video features the auditioned 7th and 8th grade Jazz Band performing **"Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me"** by Duke Ellington, arranged by DeSpain, during their spring concert.

## Program and Performance

As the first jazz ensemble to reform after pandemic closures, this group brought a new level of excitement and dedication to rehearsals and performance. With no conductor and just three weeks before the concert, our drummer stepped down — so I stepped in on drum set to support them. The students rose to the challenge with poise and musical maturity beyond their years.

## Teaching Reflection

This performance showcases the students' growth in **listening skills, ensemble independence, and confidence**. Rebuilding a jazz program after a long hiatus required patience and creativity. Jazz band is a voluntary auditioned group that rehearses twice a week before school. Because it was our first year back from the pandemic closures, our ensemble was fairly small. Because of the size, students really had to learn to be independent in their own part and sound and play confidently.
