# Junior Flute Recital

This video features my junior recital, performed live in Spring 2017 as part of my undergraduate studies in flute performance. The program includes solo and accompanied works selected to demonstrate contrasting styles and technical proficiency.

## Program

* *Partita in A Minor* – J.S. Bach
* *Sonata for Flute and Piano*, Movements II & III – Robert Muczynski
* *Ballade* – Albert Perilhou

## Performance Context

This recital was presented as a mid-degree milestone and focused on solo and chamber repertoire. The unaccompanied Bach Partita required confident pacing, dynamic control, and sustained endurance. Muczynski's Sonata presented technical and rhythmic challenges, while *Ballade* offered an opportunity to explore lyrical phrasing and color in the French Romantic tradition.

## Artistic Highlights

* Solo performance without accompaniment, developing independence and expression
* Rhythmic precision and stylistic contrast in 20th-century repertoire
* Emotional projection and stylistic nuance in French flute literature
* Preparation and performance under live recital conditions
