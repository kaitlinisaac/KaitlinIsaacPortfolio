# 8th Grade Band Spring 2022

This video features the 8th Grade Band's spring concert performance, presenting a diverse program designed to highlight students' musical growth and ensemble skills.

## Program

1. **Kilauea** – Brian Balmages  
2. **As Twilight Falls** – Robert Sheldon  
3. **Selections from The Star Wars® Saga** – arr. Michael Story  

## Performance Context

This was the first class of students I taught from the beginning of 6th grade through the end of 8th grade. After a fully virtual and hybrid year in 7th grade, this group focused on rebuilding ensemble skills, including pitch matching, balance, and stylistic awareness. COVID-19 spacing protocols remained in place throughout the year, requiring students to rehearse and perform while seated six feet apart.

## Instructional Highlights

- Development of ensemble listening and balance across all sections
- Emphasis on programmatic storytelling (*Kilauea*) and expressive playing (*As Twilight Falls*)
- Student-led repertoire request (*Star Wars*), challenging technical ability and endurance
