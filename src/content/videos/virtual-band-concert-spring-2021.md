# Virtual Band Concert Spring 2021

This video features virtual performances from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade band students during Spring 2021. Each grade-level ensemble was recorded and compiled into a complete concert video, produced and edited by me for livestream distribution to families.

## Performance Context

Students participated in band through a hybrid learning model. 6th and 7th grade students had one quarter of band, while 8th grade students had one semester. Instruction alternated between in-person and remote learning, with some students remaining fully online. Many students had no opportunity to play with peers or hear another musician in real time during the school year.

## Instructional Highlights

- Adapted curriculum for hybrid and remote instruction
- Emphasis on individual accountability, tone production, and rhythmic precision
- Video and audio editing to create a cohesive performance experience for families
