# Senior Flute Recital

This video features my senior recital, performed live in Spring 2018. The program includes Baroque, Romantic, 20th-century, and chamber repertoire, selected to demonstrate a broad range of tone, style, and technique.

## Program

*   **Sonata No. 4 "La Lumagne"** – Michel Blavet
    *   Adagio, Allemande, Sicilienne, Preston, Le Lutin
*   **Divertimento for Flute, Oboe, and Clarinet, Op. 37** – Malcolm Arnold
    *   Allegro Energico, Languido, Vivace, Andantino, Maestoso, Piacevole
    *   *With Brigid Donahue, Oboe; Madeline Amend, Clarinet*
*   **Fantaisie pour Flûte et Piano** – Philippe Gaubert
*   **Sonata for Flute and Piano, H. 306** – Bohuslav Martinů
    *   Allegro moderato, Adagio, Allegro poco moderato

## Performance Context

This capstone recital featured solo and chamber works across multiple eras. The Blavet Sonata highlighted ornamentation and phrasing in the French Baroque tradition. Arnold's *Divertimento* required close chamber collaboration and dynamic contrast. Gaubert's *Fantaisie* offered opportunities for tone color and Romantic expression, while the Martinů Sonata presented rhythmic complexity, range, and technical fluency.

## Artistic Highlights

*   Stylistic versatility across four centuries of repertoire
*   Collaborative performance in woodwind trio settings
*   Development of tone, articulation, and phrasing in varied stylistic contexts
*   Technical and expressive refinement in advanced solo works
