# My First Band Concert

This video captures my very first band performance as a fourth-grade student, playing a flute duet titled **"Tick Tock"** from the *Breeze-Easy Method Book 1*.

## Performance Context

This was the first time I ever performed on stage as a flutist. I was a very shy kid, and volunteering to play a duet in front of an audience was a big step outside my comfort zone. Band gave me the confidence to take that step â€” not just musically, but personally. Watching this moment back reminds me of how foundational that experience was in building confidence and connection through music.

I include it here as a reminder of where I started and as a tribute to the band directors and teachers who inspired me. I hope to provide that same spark for my students today.
