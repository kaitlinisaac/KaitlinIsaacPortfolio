## Why I Built This Shortcut

Originally designed to support a high school flute student preparing for an All-County Band audition, this shortcut replaces traditional flashcards and paper logs. By selecting scales randomly, students remain actively engaged and ready to perform any scale at a moment's notice. Additionally, instant logging into Apple Notes simplifies tracking student performance and makes subsequent lessons more effective and targeted.

## Tool Overview

*   Digitally streamlines traditional assessment methods.
*   Promotes dynamic practice sessions with randomized scale selection.
*   Provides instant logging and easy tracking of student progress.
*   Encourages technology integration and student engagement.
