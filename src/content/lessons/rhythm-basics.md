# Rhythm Basics: Quarter & Eighth Notes

Understanding rhythm is fundamental to music education. This lesson focuses on teaching quarter and eighth notes through accessible, engaging activities suitable for beginning band students.

## Building Rhythmic Awareness

Start with body-based activities to internalize steady pulse:

- Clapping on beat with metronome
- Stepping/marching to steady beat
- Using syllables (ta, ti-ti) to verbalize rhythms

## Notation and Counting Systems

Introduce notation alongside physical activities:

- Quarter notes (ta) = 1 beat
- Eighth notes (ti-ti) = Â½ beat each

Counting systems help students interpret rhythmic notation:
- 1, 2, 3, 4 for quarter notes
- 1-and, 2-and, 3-and, 4-and for eighth notes

## Rhythmic Building Blocks

Create simple patterns using combinations of:
- Four quarter notes (ta ta ta ta)
- Two quarter notes + four eighth notes (ta ta ti-ti ti-ti)
- Eight eighth notes (ti-ti ti-ti ti-ti ti-ti)

## Practice Activities

1. **Echo Clapping**: Teacher claps a pattern, students echo
2. **Rhythm Cards**: Visual flashcards for quick recognition
3. **Rhythm Basketball**: Students perform a rhythm correctly to earn a shot

## Assessment Strategies

Simple rhythm dictation or performance assessments help track student progress and understanding.
