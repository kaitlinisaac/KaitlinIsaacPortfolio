## The Beginning

I've spent my whole twenties trying to figure out this whole "adulting" thing, and if there's one common sentiment among fellow zillenials, it's this: It sucks.

There are amazing things about being an adult, but you never realize how much of your life is taken up by "adulting" tasks until you're doing it all on your own. (Did you know you need to clean your cleaning machines??)

My husband, Dylan, and I have navigated life together since our early twenties, always wondering, "How do people do this and still have time for what they actually want to do?"

We noticed that truly wealthy people often hire out for the tasks they don't want to do—because for them, time is more valuable than money. So they pay others for cleaning, financial planning, laundry, cooking, and more.

Dylan and I wanted to experience the same "luxury"—not by outsourcing, but by **automating** or streamlining as many tedious tasks as possible. As we improved our own lives, we wanted to help others reclaim their time, too.

This led us to start our nonprofit, **Automate the Suck Out of Life**.

We're excited to share more of our story and resources as we grow. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at the design and development process for our brand and site.

## What's in a Name?

The design process truly started with the name. We're both huge fans of Hank and John Green (DFTBA, Nerdfighteria!) and their charity, The Foundation to Decrease World Suck, was a big inspiration.

One day, Dylan said, "I kinda want to call it Automate the Suck Out of Life." I loved it—straightforward, a little edgy (almost like "automate the f** out of life," hehe), and perfectly aligned with our mission.

## Logo and Wordmark

I started the visual design by experimenting in Canva, playing with arrangements of the name and refining the spacing and sizing until it felt balanced.

### Robot Vacuum Inspiration

One of the first real automation game-changers for us was getting a robot vacuum (which we lovingly named Succ). Automating just one task freed up so much time and mental space, so I wanted to capture that feeling in our branding. That's why I designed a simple robot vacuum icon.

### Incorporating the Lightning Bolt

As I refined the logo, I wanted to add a visual element for power, speed, and automation. I brainstormed symbols—a spiral (for suction), a magic wand (for transformation)—and landed on a **lightning bolt**.

The lightning bolt felt perfect for energy and efficiency. It was also a subtle nod to our Harry Potter re-read and to electricity powering automation. Plus, a favorite song that year, "Monster" by Yung Lean, had lightning imagery, which felt right for the brand.

Once I finalized the lightning bolt as a key design element, I explored different placements in Freeform on my iPad before locking in the final design in Canva and Figma.

## Color Palette & Typography

I chose a **green color palette** to keep the brand modern, clean, and approachable. Our goal is to empower people to use technology in practical, DIY-friendly ways.

**Typography Choices:**
- Nourd (sans-serif): Clean and modern for the wordmark
- Roboto Slab: Headings, for structure
- Roboto (sans-serif): Body text, readable and professional
- Roboto Mono: Accents, like buttons

## Building the Website

After finalizing designs in Figma, I moved to development using:
- **Astro** (framework)
- **CSS** (styling)
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** (interactivity & logic)

I used Cursor AI to help generate boilerplate code, debug, and refine styling. This cut down on dev time and let me focus on user experience.

### Mobile-First Design

Since most users visit sites on mobile, I focused on:
- **Readability:** Clear typography, accessible contrast
- **Navigation:** Easy, intuitive menu for smaller screens
- **Performance:** Fast load times, lightweight assets and efficient code

## Final Thoughts

One of my favorite elements is the **hero section**—our Roomba-inspired logo "sucks up" dirt elements (asterisks ✱, as a nod to the Forever Notes Framework). This animation ties together the branding and functionality in an engaging way.

Building this site has been incredibly fun, and I love that the branding is both creative and professional. I'm excited to keep growing Automate the Suck Out of Life and sharing more projects in the future.
