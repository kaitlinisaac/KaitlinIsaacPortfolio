        As a UX designer, I create thoughtful, accessible digital experiences that center around user needs. 
        My approach combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving to design interfaces that are 
        both functional and delightful to use.

          I believe in designing with empathy, inclusivity, and accessibility at the forefront. Having transitioned from 
          music education to UX design, I bring a unique perspective on creating experiences that educate, engage, and inspire.
